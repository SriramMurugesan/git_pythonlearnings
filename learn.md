How to build AI Agents? What is Agentic AI? AI Agent Projects, AI Agents full course, AI Agents tutorials, AI Agents explained.

Dive into the cutting-edge world of autonomous AI agents that are redefining technology! In this video, we explore:

1. What Are AI Agents?
Understand how digital programs perceive, reason, and act—much like humans but with unmatched precision. Learn how these agents integrate sensors, decision-making algorithms, and action execution to transform industries.

2. Core Components & Operation:
Discover the six essential components: perception, reasoning, action, knowledge base, learning, and communication. We break down the "sense-plan-act" cycle with real-world analogies like self-driving cars and live Python code demonstrations.

3. Layered Architecture:
From the Orchestration Layer (the control center) that triggers the process, to the Models Layer where AI leverages frameworks like ReAct, Chain-of-Thought, and Tree-of-Thoughts, and finally the Tools Layer that enables real-time interactions.

4. Flow of Query in AI Agents:
Get an exclusive sneak peek into the next phase—agentic AI design patterns. Learn how these patterns empower autonomous agents to function independently and make intelligent decisions.

5. Real-World Applications:
See how AI agents are revolutionizing sectors like healthcare, finance, retail, and beyond by automating tasks, optimizing decision-making, and scaling operations 24/7.
